# CasaKitchen App
Recipe App for GA Unit 1 Project

## Description

CasaKitchen is a recipe search application that allows you to search for various recipes using food that you may already have at home. A user can also search by specific foods, such as lasagne, or cuisines, such as Italian or Mexican. A user has the option to toggle a deietary restriction for gluten-free, vegetarian, and vegan. Once recipes are populated, a user can easily view the nutrition facts by hovering over the image. Also, a user has the ability to click on the image to view the full recipe ingredients without leaving the CasaKitchen app. This allows the user to browse as many recipes as they want in one location without having to jump from page to page to get the information needed to chose their next meal.
